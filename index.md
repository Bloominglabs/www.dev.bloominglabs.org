excerpt: >-
  Bloominglabs is Indiana's first hackerspace (also known as a makerspace). We are a group of people who rent a shared workshop where we can build projects both collectively and individually.
  <br><br>
  Our space is located at 1840 S. Walnut Street in Bloomington, Indiana. We are open to the public Wednesday evenings from 7:00 PM until 10:00 PM. Our open hours are family friendly.
  Come build projects, ask questions, teach things, and learn stuff. Everyone is welcome!
  <br><br>
  During public meetings, our doors are open and the space is available for anyone to use. There is no fee to use the space while it is open to the public, and only a few (clearly-marked) tools require payment to use. We also have many parts and materials that have been donated and are free to be used. If you have any questions, please ask any member and they can help you find the answer.

intro: 
  # - excerpt: "We are a bunch of people that want to do interesting things and explore the world and technology around us. Expression of this interest takes at least as many forms as we have members, and often employs an amalgam of found and newly-constructed hardware and/or open-source and self-authored software components, but may be as simple as screwing some pieces of wood together to make a useful tool we don't have yet.<br><br>Bloominglabs was forged from the Bloomington Hackerspace Initiative and the former IU Robotics Club.<br><br>A hackerspace is a physical location where people can share resources for their own creative pursuits. It's also a resource where people can come in off the street and advance their own knowledge. In urban locations it can often be hard to find places to weld/build/make noise and keep projects on-going without having to tear down and put-up your work each evening. With a hacker space people can work on their projects and not worry about annoying their neighbors or spouses. The social aspect is also an incredibly important component. Having people to bounce ideas off of and discuss your projects with when you get stuck is a great thing."
